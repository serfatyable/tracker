# Production Deployment Tasks List

**Project:** Tracker - Anesthesiology Residency Training Management Platform
**Status:** Ready for Limited Production (6.4/10)
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Branch:** `claude/deployment-tasks-list-011CUbNYqnnYpbneyJVtpuHd`

---

## Executive Summary

The Tracker application has a **solid foundation** with strong architecture, comprehensive security headers, proper authentication, and good code quality. However, it requires **critical operational infrastructure** before handling real user data in production.

**Current Status:**

- ✅ Core application features complete
- ✅ Authentication & authorization working
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Firestore security rules comprehensive
- ❌ No rate limiting (CRITICAL)
- ❌ No error tracking service (CRITICAL)
- ❌ No automated backups (HIGH RISK)
- ❌ Tests not in CI pipeline
- ❌ ICS endpoints unauthenticated

---

## Priority Classification

- **P0 (BLOCKER):** Must be completed before production deployment
- **P1 (CRITICAL):** Required for safe production operation
- **P2 (HIGH):** Should be completed within first week of production
- **P3 (MEDIUM):** Should be completed within first month
- **P4 (LOW):** Nice to have, can be deferred
