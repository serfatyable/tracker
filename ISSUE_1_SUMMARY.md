# Issue #1 Fix - Quick Summary

**Fixed:** ✅ Tutors can now ONLY read tasks from their assigned residents

---

## What Changed

### 1. Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)

- ✅ Added `isTutorForTask()` function
- ✅ Updated task read rule to check `task.tutorIds`

### 2. Task Creation (`lib/firebase/db.ts`)

- ✅ Modified `createTask()` to include `tutorIds` from assignment
- ✅ New tasks are immediately authorized for assigned tutors

### 3. Sync Utilities (`lib/firebase/task-sync.ts`) - NEW FILE

- ✅ `syncTutorIdsToTasks()` - Update tasks when assignments change
- ✅ `watchAssignmentsAndSyncTasks()` - Auto-sync in real-time
- ✅ `migrateExistingTasks()` - One-time migration for existing data

### 4. Enhanced Hooks (`lib/firebase/task-hooks.ts`) - NEW FILE

- ✅ `createTaskWithTutorIds()` - Alternative task creation
- ✅ `useCreateTaskWithAuth()` - React hook

---

## How It Works

**Before:**

```
Tutor queries tasks → Gets ALL tasks → Client filters → Tutor sees assigned only
❌ Tutor got unnecessary data
❌ Firestore couldn't enforce restriction
```

**After:**

```
Tutor queries tasks → Firestore checks task.tutorIds → Returns authorized only
✅ Firestore enforces at database level
✅ Efficient - no unnecessary data transfer
```

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Immediate (Required)

- [x] Update Firestore rules (already done ✅)
- [ ] Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Run migration to add tutorIds to existing tasks

### Migration Command

```typescript
// Run this ONCE after deploying rules
import { migrateExistingTasks } from './lib/firebase/task-sync';

const result = await migrateExistingTasks();
console.log(`✅ Migrated ${result.updated} tasks`);
```

### Optional (Recommended)

- [ ] Enable auto-sync OR deploy Cloud Function
- [ ] Test with real tutor accounts
- [ ] Monitor for any permission errors

---

## Testing

### Quick Test

```typescript
// 1. Sign in as tutor assigned to Resident A
// 2. Query tasks:
const tasks = await getDocs(query(collection(db, 'tasks')));

// Before: Would see tasks from all residents
// After: Only sees tasks from Resident A ✅
```

## What to Do Next

1. **Deploy Firestore rules:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Run migration** (one time):
   - Create admin page at `/admin/migrate-tasks`
   - Or run `migrateExistingTasks()` in browser console
   - See `ISSUE_1_FIX_GUIDE.md` for code

3. **Enable auto-sync** (choose one):
   - **Option A:** Real-time sync in client (see guide)
   - **Option B:** Cloud Function (recommended for production)

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Sign in as different tutors
   - Verify they only see assigned residents' tasks
