# XLSX Module Loading Fix - Applied

## ✅ Changes Completed

All fixes have been applied to resolve the `"Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/xlsx@0.18.5.js'"` error.

### Files Modified:

1. **`/lib/on-call/excel.ts`**
   - ✅ Removed static `import * as XLSX`
   - ✅ Added dynamic `await import('xlsx')`
   - ✅ Made `parseOnCallExcel` async (returns Promise)
   - ✅ Client-side only implementation

2. **`/app/api/on-call/import/route.ts`**
   - ✅ Created server-side parsing function `parseOnCallExcelServer`
   - ✅ Uses dynamic import for xlsx on server
   - ✅ Self-contained parsing logic for API route
   - ✅ Removed dependency on client-side parser

3. **`/app/admin/on-call/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Removed static import of `parseOnCallExcel`
   - ✅ Added dynamic import: `await import('../../../lib/on-call/excel')`
   - ✅ Added error logging for debugging

4. **`/next.config.js`**
   - ✅ Added webpack configuration
   - ✅ Set fallback for Node.js modules (fs, net, tls, crypto, stream, zlib)
   - ✅ Only applies to client-side builds

## 🚀 Next Steps: Restart Dev Server

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

# 2. Clear Next.js build cache
rm -rf .next

# 3. Start dev server again
pnpm dev
```

## ✨ What This Fixes

- **Before**: Next.js tried to bundle xlsx for the browser, causing module resolution errors
- **After**: xlsx is only loaded dynamically when needed, separately for client and server

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard → On-Call tab
2. Click "Upload Schedule" button
3. Select an Excel file
4. Preview should load without errors
5. Confirm import should work successfully

## 📝 Technical Details

### Why This Works:

1. **Dynamic Imports**: The xlsx library is now loaded at runtime using `await import()` instead of at build time
2. **Separate Parsing**: Client and server each have their own parsing logic with proper xlsx imports
3. **Webpack Fallbacks**: Browser build doesn't try to include Node.js modules that don't exist in the browser
4. **Lazy Loading**: xlsx is only loaded when actually needed (when user selects a file)

### Key Changes:

- Client-side parser returns a `Promise` (async)
- Server-side parser is self-contained in the API route
- No shared parsing code between client and server
- Webpack configured to ignore Node.js modules on client side

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

After restarting:
- ✅ No console errors about missing vendor chunks
- ✅ Excel file upload works smoothly
- ✅ Preview dialog displays correctly
- ✅ Import completes successfully
- ✅ Both template generation and import work

## 🔍 If Issues Persist

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Console**: Look for new error messages
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node 18+ 
4. **Reinstall Dependencies**: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`

## 📊 Status

- ✅ Code changes: Complete
- ✅ Linting: Passed
- ⏳ Dev server restart: **Action Required**
- ⏳ Testing: Pending your verification

---

**Ready to test!** Just restart your dev server and the xlsx import should work perfectly. 🎉
